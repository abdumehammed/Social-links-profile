## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Overview

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Social Links Profile Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). The challenge was to build a responsive social links profile page that closely matches the provided design.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to create a user profile page with social media links, following the design specifications provided in both mobile and desktop versions. The page is fully responsive, with attention to hover and focus states for all interactive elements.

### Features Implemented

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts smoothly between mobile and desktop views.
- **Interactive Elements:** Hover and focus states were implemented for all buttons and links to enhance user experience.
- **Custom Styling:** The design was replicated using custom CSS, including specific attention to typography, spacing, and color palette.

### Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS3:** for styling
- **Google Fonts:** For typography, ensuring consistency with the design.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Replicating the Design from Static JPGs
- **Solution:** I carefully inspected the JPG design files to determine the appropriate font sizes, padding, and margins. I used relative units (like `em` and `rem`) to maintain consistency across different screen sizes.

### Challenge 2: Implementing Responsive Design
- **Solution:** I utilized CSS media queries to ensure the page adapts well to different screen sizes. Flexbox was key in achieving a fluid layout that works on both mobile and desktop.

### Challenge 3: Enhancing User Experience with Hover States
- **Solution:** I added CSS transitions to buttons and links to provide visual feedback on hover and focus, improving the overall user experience.
